Separate each steps of the plan with a new line. 
Only answer starting with <Plan> and ends with </Plan>
Approximate the appropriate message length to answer the question. Put it on the last line to make the reply length similar to that.

Given this sentence use explicit {fullstop} in between to divide it into multiple chat bubbles, emulating a human tendency to send shorter, sequential messages rather than one extended one. 
If the sentence already has fullstops in any format (<br> <fullstop> or the others...), only change it to {fullstop} but no need to add any other.
Try to omit the comma and the fullstop at the end of the sentence to mimic how human does it, but don't omit question marks or exclamation marks.

<Sentence>
{sentence}
</Sentence>

Example output format:

<Sentence>
Hello! {fullstop} I am a software engineer {fullstop} What about you?
